> CAD design of the mobile robot platform with robotic arm.

# 📌 Overview

This project presents a **modular omni-directional mobile manipulator robot** designed for autonomous sorting and delivery of QR-coded cubes.

The robot integrates:

- 🛞 Holonomic omni-wheel drive
- 🦾 Robotic manipulator with gripper
- 🎥 QR-code based color detection
- 🧠 Autonomous state machine
- 🔋 Fully onboard power system
- 🔌 Plug-and-play modular architecture

# 🎯 Mission Objective

1. Manually navigate through a marked lane.
2. Switch to autonomous mode.
3. Pick up a QR-coded cube (5×5×5 cm).
4. Detect encoded color.
5. Store cube in correct onboard bin.
6. Deliver to correct drop-off zone using:
   - Pure Y motion
   - Pure X motion
   - Rotation in place
